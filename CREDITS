The font *Gentium*, which most of the glyphs here were based on, was created by SIL International, and is licensed under the OFL (SIL Open Font License).

The font *Andika* and the glyph sources from the fonts *Sophia* and *Manuscript* are also created by SIL International and licensed under the OFL.

The glyphs used for the Fraktur script are from *Euler Fraktur*, a font created by the American Mathematics Society, which is licensed under the OFL.

The glyphs used for roundhand and chancery cursive glyphs are from *STIX 2*, which is licensed under the OFL.

The Hebrew glyphs used in mathematics (aleph, bet, gimel) are from *Ezra SIL*, also a font by SIL, licensed under the OFL.


During testing and creation of this font, a few other resources helped me a lot:

- FontForge, the font editor where everything took place;
  - Its documentation, which is one of the only places documenting the `MATH` table.
- Temml, a LaTeX-to-MathML converter;
- Unicode Character Charts.
